We did the html file, as well as css to try and set the start page before our game
We are now trying to make the start button redirect to a new page to begin the game
-made the css grid and placed the components in their proper spots
-setting up the ScoreBoard and the scorekeeper

Next session we are going to start building the game on the second page, as well as figuring out how to randomize the placement of the apples
We are also going to try make the start screen look better as well as adding the functionality to the page and change the item from an apple to give it a theme
